All you need is to have The Hobbit (either of the three by Peter Jackson will do) in your computer's blu-ray or DVD drive, or stored in a folder on your computer (note: you must be able to access said folder). Movies contain more than enough lame moments to power this script for a month at least. Turns out the things we all like to hate on and bash (pun intended) can sometimes find their use in the most unlikely of places."

  echo "NOTE 2: FFmpeg is still required (newest stable will do), and LAME (likewise, newest stable will do) is of course preferred to Peter Jackson's The Hobbit movies. Unlike LAME, the movies aren't very 'stable' as they are fundamentally broken (few examples of known bugs: Azog, stone giants, things under the goblin mountain, legolass, Smaug with his insecurities (which probably stem from the fact he isn't a dragon but a wyvern instead) and of course, neither last nor least and (ironically) probably the biggest source of lameness in the movies so far: the barrel scene). As as result, they may segfault a lot. This may result in data loss (even without the -d option)."
